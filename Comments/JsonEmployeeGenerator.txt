1) 
I would separate logic inside the method into separate privaete methods.
This way we will refactor the code to follow the first of SOLID principles - Single Responsibility

2)
I would suggest using StringBuilder over string interpolation.
This way we would improve performance

3)
I would suggest wrapping File.CreateText into a using statement
the method Flush() only clears the pipeline, but does not dispose the object.
The object already implements IDisposable so it would make sense for us to dispose it and improve performance
